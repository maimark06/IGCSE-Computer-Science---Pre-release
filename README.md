# IGCSE-Computer-Science---Pre-release-0478-22
Hi guys, to those who might find this a little bit useful (reviewing for future IGCSE Exam), my code is just one of the solution (which might work) for the pre-release material of paper 2/2022. In real exam, you just need to write the pseudocode version of this, however, it is always better to step ahead and challenge yourself to code the pre-release material by using either python or java as in the actual exam, you will have a more general idea of how this task works and as a result, "question 1" will become a piece of cake:)). Anyways, GOOD LUCK and BEST WISHES if you are going through the IGCSE CS.
